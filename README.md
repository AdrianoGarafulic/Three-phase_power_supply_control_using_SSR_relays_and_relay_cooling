With the help of an arduino microcontroller and an SSR relay, control of the mains power supply up to 50A was made. Since the relays are heating, it is necessary to perform cooling of the relays, or automation that will turn on the fan in the relay housing if the temperature exceeds a certain value. The user in this case had two options of power supply, via the mains or via the generator. The problem is that every time he should physically turn on and off the fuses or switches when turning on or off the unit that is far from the distribution cabinet. The user is enabled to turn the power supply on or off remotely via the application interface. The user can also control the cooling of the relay and set the temperature value to which the automatic switches off the relays so that ignition does not occur in the event of overheating. It also has a current and historical display of the temperature movement in the relay housing as well as the performance of the relay cooling.
